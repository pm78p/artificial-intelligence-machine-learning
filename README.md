[1-ICU italy dataset](https://github.com/pm78p/root/tree/main/Machine%20learning/1-ICU%20italy%20dataset) - Here we modeled ICU italy dataset with help of the some methods
(Multy layer perceptron, Random forest, ada boost, linear regression). The results for each methods listed below:

[2-sarcasm detection dataset](https://github.com/pm78p/root/tree/main/Machine%20learning/2-sarcasm%20detection%20dataset) - Here After doing some Data visualization and  Data
preprocessing we modeled sarcasm on reddit dataset from kaggle with help of the some methods.
In one way we use TF-IDF embedding method, then we train, a. Logistic Regression - b. SVM - c. Ada Boost, models on data. 
In other way we embedd text with the help of the Word2Vec and train RNN model.
The results for each methods listed below:

[3-data cleaning & EDA & Dimension Reduction](https://github.com/pm78p/root/tree/main/Machine%20learning/3-data%20cleaning%20%26%20EDA%20%26%20Dimension%20Reduction) -

[4-regression](https://github.com/pm78p/root/tree/main/Machine%20learning/4-regression) - Here we use "The Boston Housing" Dataset. Fisrt, we compare gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent on this dataset. Next, a. implement 1st order regression with SSE
as cost function - b. 3rd order regression with SSE as cost function - c. 3rd order regression with SSE as cost function and a regularization term and predict test data.
Last, we use a 10-fold cross validation.

[5-logistic reg & ada boost](https://github.com/pm78p/root/tree/main/Machine%20learning/5-logistic%20reg%20%26%20ada%20boost) - Here we use "Blood Transfusion Service Center"
dataset. First, we train logistic regression classiﬁer and a decision tree to classify the dataset. Then, fine tuning models. Finally, Train an AdaBoost classiﬁer that each weak 
learner is a stump (Stumps are decision trees with depth one).

[6-probabilistic graphical models](https://github.com/pm78p/root/tree/main/Machine%20learning/6-probabilistic%20graphical%20models) - Here we try to use probabilistic graphical models
to denoising messages in a related dataset

[7-clustering k-means & EM & GMM](https://github.com/pm78p/root/tree/main/Machine%20learning/7-clustering%20k-means%20%26%20EM%20%26%20GMM) - Here we made a random dataset via sklearn 
by make_classification function in this library. Then, implementing k-means and GMM to classify the datas.
